Retinal vascular diseases are the utmost cause of visibility loss and blindness 
where the blood vessels in the eyes somehow fail to circulate the appropriate level of 
blood flow. Early and correctdetection of retinal blood vessels facilitates humans to 
take expedient remedy against most of the ophthalmic diseases which can significantly 
reduce possible vision loss. Thispaper presents a Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation 
(RBVS) which is inspired by the popular MATLAB architecture.
Proper utilization of deep learning lead MATLAB to achieve to outperform the 
state of the art accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three
benchmark retinal fundus image datasets, where the proposed approach achieves more 
than 96% average accuracy for vessel segmentation. A comparison with other recent 
works also demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach to segment the blood 
vessel from the retinal color fundus image. Therefore, this study helps to find out 
major problems diagnosis that is the segmentation of retinal blood vessels in fundus 
images followed by the length of the segmented blood vessels.
